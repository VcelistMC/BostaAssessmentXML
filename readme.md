# Bosta Assessment - Android App

## Overview

This project is an Android application developed as part of a technical assessment for Bosta.

## Approach

### 1. **Architecture & Structure**
- **MVVM Pattern:**  
  The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, separating concerns between UI, business logic, and data sources.
- **Clean Code Principles:**  
  Code is organized into clear packages: `data`, `ui`, `viewmodels`, etc...
- **Base Classes:**  
  Common functionality for Fragments and ViewModels is abstracted into base classes (`BaseFragment`, `BaseViewModel`).

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
- **Hilt (Dagger):**  
  The project uses [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting testability.


### 3. **Networking**
- **Retrofit & Gson:**  
  The app uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for network requests and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- **Repository Pattern:**  
  Data access is abstracted via a repository (`CityRepo`), which interacts with the network layer and provides data to the ViewModel.

### 4. **UI & User Experience**
- **ViewBinding:**  
  Enabled for type-safe and efficient view access.
- **RecyclerView:**  
  Used to display the list of cities and their districts.
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Real-time filtering of cities and districts as the user types.
  - The search is case-insensitive and matches both city names and district names.
  - If a city matches, all its districts are shown; if only districts match, only those districts are shown under their city.

### 5. **Asynchronous Operations**
- **Coroutines:**  
  All network and data operations are performed asynchronously using Kotlin coroutines, ensuring a responsive UI.

## Code Snippet: Search Logic

```kotlin
fun filterCities(query: String): List<City>{
  if (query.isBlank()) {
    return fullCityList
  }

  // filter cities where either the city or at least one district matches
  val matchingCities = fullCityList.filter { city ->
    city.cityName.lowercase().startsWith(query) ||
            city.districts.any { district ->
              district.districtName.lowercase().startsWith(query)
            }
  }

  val refinedResults = matchingCities.map { city ->
    val cityNameMatches = city.cityName.lowercase().startsWith(query)

    if (cityNameMatches) {
      // If the city name matches, keep it and all its districts
      city
    } else {
      // Otherwise, keep only the matching districts
      val matchingDistricts = city.districts.filter { district ->
        district.districtName.lowercase().startsWith(query)
      }
      city.copy(districts = matchingDistricts)
    }
  }

  return refinedResults
}
```
